		<p>How did your sector do? Is everyone a team player? …No?</p>
		<p>Well, now’s your chance to prove it! You can investigate the teammate 
		you find most suspicious to see if they really have been choosing to be selfish. 
		You can place a bet on this player’s selfishness, and if you are correct, you get
		some of the player’s points and your own points. If you falsely accuse them, 
		then you win nothing. </p>
