<h1> Energy Race </h1>
<p id="energyEvent"> The future is here: nuclear fusion. Governments are racing to harvest the universeâ€™s premiere energy source, the fuel of the suns themselves, in order to power their people, their strength, their existence. What fossil fuels remain cost less for now, but as soon as nuclear fusion becomes feasible, it will be cheaper than any other source.</p>
<h2> Instructions </h2>
<p> Each player can pay 2 points of their individual score to donate to the race to fusion.  Once you donate, those 2 points are gone.  However, the nation with the most donations will receive a 10 point bonus.  If you donate and your country does not win, you have lost 2 individual points with no benefit.
