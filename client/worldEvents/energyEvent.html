<p id="energyEvent"> The future is here: nuclear fusion. Governments are racing to harvest the universe's premiere energy source, the fuel of the suns themselves, in order to power their people, their strength, their existence. What fossil fuels remain cost less for now, but as soon as nuclear fusion becomes a feasible source, it will be unlimited and cheaper than any other source. Germany has already taken note, and now the money usually funneled to fuel spreads to the welfare of its citizens and thus a better, cheaper quality of life. How excited are you for the fuel revolution? If most people in your nation choose to fund fusion, then scientists can finally make the breakthrough and power your nation! </p>
