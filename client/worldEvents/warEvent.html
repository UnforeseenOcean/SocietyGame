<p id="warEvent"> Tensions rise in the current superpower due to the mounting economic instability and shrinking resources. Switzerland, seeing a downturn in their financial sector, continues to see many citizens leave for work in the leading economic power. To reduce the population, the superpower bans immigration from Switzerland, claiming Switzerland's citizens are crippling the superpower's workforce. Switzerland responds to the actions of that nation and blocks trade with it, and Switzerland wipes all financial accounts held by citizens of the superpower. Enraged by this, the nation declares war on Switzerland. What side do you support? </p>
