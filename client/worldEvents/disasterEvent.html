<p id="disasterEvent"> Mt. Vesuvius has finally erupted, and Naples is all but eradicated. Refugees from the area have relocated to shelters in Rome. The Italian government is accepting food and medicine donations from Italians and foreign people alike; in this time of crisis, they are even urging other nations to grant stranded survivors visas to seek work elsewhere, since the Italian market is not faring well. How do you help the Italian efforts? </p>
