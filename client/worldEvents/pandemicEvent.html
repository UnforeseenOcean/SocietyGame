		<h1> The Choking Laugh Pandemic </h1>
		<p id="pandemicEvent"> Several nations have been reporting about the HN2CO2 virus, or the Choking Laugh. Sources say the virus mutated from a strain of Avian Flu that came into exposure with laughing gas in France, and now the virus has spread across Europe and Africa, slowly making its way to Asia and America. In preventative efforts, some countries, such as Switzerland, are closing their borders. Others, such as Chile, are creating coalitions to find a cure for the strain. If you or someone you know starts to fall ill, here are the symptoms to look for: fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, blue nails, and black patches. If any of these symptoms persist, get immediate medical attention. If an infected person begins laughing uncontrollably and turning pale, call 911. If left untreated, individuals with Choking Laugh will die with a 70% mortality rate. </p>
		<h2> INSTRUCTIONS </h2>
		<p> If your country votes to keep its borders open, your country will lose 4 points but the world will gain 6 points.  If your country votes to close its borders, your country will gain 4 points, but the world will lose 6 points. </p>
