<p id="olympicsEvent"> People of the world, rejoice! It is time for the Summer Olympics! Each nation may send participants to the events, and each individual can cheer on their nation. The participants with the highest individual scores will win the competition, so choose your members wisely! </p>

<p id="disasterEvent"> Mt. Vesuvius has finally erupted, and Naples is all but eradicated. Refugees from the area have relocated to shelters in Rome. The Italian government is accepting food and medicine donations from Italians and foreign people alike—in this time of crisis, they are even urging other nations to grant stranded survivors visas to seek work elsewhere, since the Italian market is not faring well. How do you help the Italian efforts? </p>

<p id="energyEvent"> The future is here: nuclear fusion. Governments are racing to harvest the universe’s premiere energy source, the fuel of the suns themselves, in order to power their people, their strength, their existence. What fossil fuels remain cost less for now, but as soon as nuclear fusion becomes a feasible source, it will be unlimited and cheaper than any other source. Germany has already taken note, and now the money usually funneled to fuel spreads to the welfare of its citizens and thus a better, cheaper quality of life. How excited are you for the fuel revolution? </p>

<p id="pandemicEvent"> Several nations have been reporting about the HN2CO2 virus, or the Choking Laugh. Sources say the virus mutated from a strain of Avian Flu that came into exposure with laughing gas in France, and now the virus has spread across Europe and Africa, slowly making its way to Asia and America. In preventative efforts, some countries, such as Switzerland, are closing their borders. Others, such as Chile, are creating coalitions to find a cure for the strain. If you or someone you know starts to fall ill, here are the symptoms to look for: fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, blue nails, and black patches. If any of these symptoms persist, get immediate medical attention. If an infected person begins laughing uncontrollably and turning pale, call 911 and hope they don’t choke before paramedics arrive. If left untreated, individuals with Choking Laugh will die with a 70% mortality rate. What will you do?</p>

<p id="warEvent"> Tensions rise in the current superpower due to the mounting economic instability and shrinking resources. Switzerland, seeing a downturn in their financial sector, continues to see many citizens leave for work in the leading economic power. To reduce the population, the superpower bans immigration from Switzerland, claiming Switzerland's citizens are crippling the superpower's workforce. Switzerland responds to the actions of that nation and blocks trade with it, and Switzerland wipes all financial accounts held by citizens of the superpower. Enraged by this, the nation declares war on Switzerland. What side do you support? </p>
